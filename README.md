# DiploPad

DiploPad is a computer adjudicator and virtual notepad toolkit for the board game *Diplomacy*.

## Goals

These are the goals I want to meet with DiploPad to set it apart from online *Diplomacy* websites'
adjudication engines. DiploPad will have a...

1. **Configurable and extensible adjudicator.** Playgroups may differ on how relaxed adjudication
should be, such as in the case of a spelling error, ambiguous abbreviation, or unspecified coast.
DiploPad should accomodoate a variety of house rules.

2. **Introspective adjudication.** The user should be able to inquire about any aspect of the
adjudication process and get a detailed description of why an order was resolved how it was.

3. **Stepwise adjudication.** If requested, the adjudicator will be able to walk through, in order,
each order made on a turn.

4. **Friendly UI for writing and submitting orders and reading their resolution.** Users can
connect to a server from their device to play in a game together, using the DiploPad UI as a
substitute for physical moves submission.

## Non-goals

As of now, providing a map-interface or a chat server for press is not in the scope of my
objective with DiploPad. DiploPad is meant to be used in conjunction with in-person games
over a physical board. Convening over a live board is one of the most important characteristics
of in-person play, and I have no intention to subvert that.

DiploPad will instruct users on how to move the pieces according to the results of adjudication
instead of showing them a digital board.
